How do you deal with such situation? Well, fortunately, that’s when your online car insurance policy comes into its role play.</p>

                                    Car insurance is an essential requirement. And it is mandatory by law too, as per the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. The numbers of vehicles on road have gone considerably high throughout the past few decades. India is a country of diversity as well as of uncertainties. You can witness more motor vehicles in the street than pedestrians nowadays. The conditions of the metropolitan cities are even worse. <br>
                                    With the rising numbers of cars in the street have risen the numbers of accidents as well. On an average, approximately 400 deaths per day are witnessed from a vehicle accident while over 1200 road crashes occurs every day in India. All these statistics certainly calls for robust safety measures to keep the life of yours as well as your family protected against any unforeseen vehicle accident. <br>
                                    Apart from that, an accident of your vehicle can cause you a hefty amount for the repairing or the replacement. A comprehensive car insurance policy, therefore, is highly recommended to have the ultimate level of security as well as peace of mind in the course of your car ride. Everyone wants to have the best car insurance policy for themselves, and there isn’t anything wrong in this. <br>
                                    It’s our right to have the best policy since we are putting our hard earned money on the protection of our vehicle. Still a big chunk of the motor owners only go for the compulsory third party motor insurance policy. They don’t go for the comprehensive auto insurance plan; and this decision could be, in turn, a blunder in case of an accident or serious injury or damage due to an accident. <br>
                                    However, you will have to keep a few things in mind if you want to avail the best car insurance policy in India at the lowest price with extensive coverage.

                           Factors That Determine Car Insurance Quotes Online in India
                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <div class="card-body new-car">
                           <p> Car insurance quotes online in India depend on some parameters. To calculate online car insurance quotes you need to look at the following criteria:</p>
                           <ul class="list">
                              <li>
                                 Find out the correct age of the vehicle that helps to evaluate online car insurance quote. Online car insurance quote increases as the vehicle gets older. There are three age-slabs to determine motor insurance quotes online like 5, 10 and 15 years. If you compare car insurance quotes online as per the age, you can see that older cars trigger higher online car insurance quotes.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 Cubic capacity of the vehicles is the prime feature to calculate online car insurance quotes. Similar to age, the cars with higher cubic capacity also attract higher car insurance quotes online. There are three slabs such as less than 1000 cc, between 1000 cc and 1500 cc and more than 1500 cc to assess online car insurance quotes according to cubic capacity.
                              </li>
                              <li>IDV of the car helps to figure out the quote. As the Insured Declared Value (IDV) increases, online motor insurance quotes get elevated as well. If you make car insurance quotes comparison of two cars with same IDV or Insured Declared value, car insurance quotes online will differ on the basis of other factors</li>
                              <li>Vehicle registration location also helps to assess online car insurance quote. It plays an instrumental role in working out online car insurance quotes. There are two zones in terms of car insurance quotes. Zone A consists of 8 major cities in India where auto insurance quotes are higher. The rest of India comes under zone B and car insurance quotes are lower in zone B. If you make car insurance quote comparison in terms of these two zones, cars registered in zone A will attract higher online car insurance quotes because the risk of accident and theft is higher in zone A.
                                 Your four wheeler type also influences car insurance quotes online
                              </li>
                              <li>Type of the fuel of car determines online motor insurance quotes</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Apart from these, if you make online car insurance quotes comparison of two vehicles of the same age, car insurance quotes online will vary in terms of cubic capacity and location.</p>

However, rates are around 20% more than standard 4-wheeler insurance coverage.</p>

                           <p>Hypothecation is a method of establishing liens on the security of movable assets. The borrower retains ownership of the goods. In the case of a car loan, for example, the borrower retains ownership of the vehicle, but it is hypothecated to the bank. It means that if the borrower defaults on the car loan, the bank has the right to sell the vehicle.</p>
						   <p>To include hypothecation in a car insurance policy, follow these steps: </p>
						   <p> <b style="color:black;">• </b>A letter from the bank or financer, as well as an endorsed RC copy, must be given to the insurance company's office.</p>
						   <p> To remove hypothecation from a car insurance policy, do the following: </p>
						   <p> <b style="color:black;">• </b>The insurance company's office must get a no objection certificate (NOC)/endorsed RC copy.</p>
						   <p>If the payment must be received by the policyholder, it is critical to obtain NOC from the financer in the case of a hypothecated car. Otherwise, for losses to the car other than theft, the claim amount will be reimbursed to the financer.</p>
