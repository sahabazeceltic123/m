  "text": " Car insurance quotes online in India depend on some parameters. To calculate online car insurance quotes you need to look at the following criteria:Find out the correct age of the vehicle that helps to evaluate online car insurance quote. Online car insurance quote increases as the vehicle gets older. There are three age-slabs to determine motor insurance quotes online like 5, 10 and 15 years. If you compare car insurance quotes online as per the age, you can see that older cars trigger higher online car insurance quotes.Cubic capacity of the vehicles is the prime feature to calculate online car insurance quotes. Similar to age, the cars with higher cubic capacity also attract higher car insurance quotes online. There are three slabs such as less than 1000 cc, between 1000 cc and 1500 cc and more than 1500 cc to assess online car insurance quotes according to cubic capacity.IDV of the car helps to figure out the quote. As the Insured Declared Value (IDV) increases, online motor insurance quotes get elevated as well. If you make car insurance quotes comparison of two cars with same IDV or Insured Declared value, car insurance quotes online will differ on the basis of other factors Vehicle registration location also helps to assess online car insurance quote. It plays an instrumental role in working out online car insurance quotes. There are two zones in terms of car insurance quotes. Zone A consists of 8 major cities in India where auto insurance quotes are higher. The rest of India comes under zone B and car insurance quotes are lower in zone B. If you make car insurance quote comparison in terms of these two zones, cars registered in zone A will attract higher online car insurance quotes because the risk of accident and theft is higher in zone A. Your four wheeler type also influences car insurance quotes online Type of the fuel of car determines online motor insurance quotes Apart from these, if you make online car insurance quotes comparison of two vehicles of the same age, car insurance quotes online will vary in terms of cubic capacity and location."
